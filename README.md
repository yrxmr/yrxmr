I'm Yara, a data scientist with a strong background in NLP and cognitive sciences. My journey began with a BA in Linguistics, where I developed a fascination for the human brain, leading me to pursue an MSc in Cognitive Science. I explored second language acquisition using behavioral experiments (masked priming) and EEG techniques. As a lab technician, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis with R Studio and Python. This sparked my interest in coding and led me to pursue an MSc in NLP. Currently, I leverage my skills in data science and machine learning in the railway industry, working on predictive maintenance and sentiment analysis.
